class.

Submit detailed answers to the following in this file via a pull request:

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.
-   The data structure you plan to use.
-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
-   How you plan to approach this project.
-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
-   What creative spin will you add to your project?
-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?
-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?

- I'm planning on storing the data in an array
- similar to the the way we created the cards in fundamentals, I intend to render
  each block in JS and have clicks assign values to the blocks and to the array
- I plan to work in small chunks, starting with basic layout, then authentication,
  and finally finish with the JS logic.
- User Stories:
    I will be able to log in and see my user history
    I will be able to click on boxes and change their values
    I will be able to play against friends
    I will experience the thrill of the draw
- I will keep my code modular by writing in it a series of small, interconnected
  files that each cover a specific part of the project.
- I'm rather partial to plaid, and given that tic tac toe is a grid I plan on
  giving it a plaid theme, with plaid backgrounds to the page and the X and O's.
- I will use git to commit changes frequently so that I can double back when I
  inevitably break something.
- I'm not currently planning any bonuses, but if I finish with any time to spare
  I will absolutely look into them.
